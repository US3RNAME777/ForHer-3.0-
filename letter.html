            <p>Hii Shachu</p>
            <p>Okay this is 13th feb, 04:23am rn and well I okay honestly this website was intended for your bday but I was never able to complete it coz train mein yk kya halat thi kabhi idhr kabhi udhr and upar se ghr aake didi ki shaadi and then well yk 1st November se things started to get the way they did and I never finished this. But 
                Now that I wanted to do something for you on this valentine's day, I thought why not complete this and make it a valentines gift for you. I know it's not much but I hope you like it. I'm not changing this much, tbh sab kuch jaisa tha vaisa hi hai bas I'm editing this letter completly and happy birthday ko har jagah happy valentines kr raha hu.
                Ik that rn I have no right to call you my valentine but my sweet baby that doesn't mean that I can't feel like that or think like that or believe like that.
                And its okay if you don't want me to be your valentine or you don't wanna be mine but for me you'll always be my valentine baby no matter what. 
                Dekh things aren't the best right now and ik i've been too much up your ass to be honest and ik somewhere you do get why I'm doing what I'm doing shachu. 
                I just want you to know that I love you baby 
                I really really extremely love you and ik you really really ekdum bohot zyada wala love krte ho merese and itni jaldi aise hi give up ni krne wala mai shachu.
                All of this the video and this website maybe might just overwhelm you (I really hope it doesn't) 
                I'm not doing this to get you back shachu uske liye i'm trying vaise, this is to show you that yes we aren't the way we were, yes things are bad but you're still and will always be My cutu baby, My cutu malkin, mera smol gulab jamun, mera cupcake, you'll always be my valentine shachu and none of this will ever make me love you any less than I do. 
                Rather it's only making me love you more and that's the only good part about this.  
            </p>
            <p>So yeah, I just hope you know that I love you and i'm here and we can be so much better my sweet cutu lil baby. Happy Valentines Day. Forever yours.</p>
